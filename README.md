1.0

Available for
----------------
astah* professional 8.3 or later, astah* UML 8.3 or later

Description
----------------
A plugin for constructing [C4 model](https://c4model.com).

How to install
----------------
0. Download .jar file from
   https://github.com/ChangeVision/astah-c4model-plugin/releases/tag/v1.0
1. Launch Astah and drag the downloaded .jar file to an open instance of Astah. A pop-up will appear asking you to confirm installation, choose [Yes].
2. If the pop-up opens, restart Astah and open any project.
3. Now you will have [C4 model] Tab in the Extension View below the Diagram Editor.


How to use
----------------
### Setup

1. Open project [c4model-skeleton.asta] in the [sample] folder.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_01a.png) 
   - You can see the stereotypes with the associated SVG images registered to the project.  You can register two or more images to one stereotype.
   - Another way is to use the svg image files, which are registered in the c4model-skeleton.asta project file, placed at the same place in the zip format.  Please check [a manual page of Astah](https://astah.net/support/astah-pro/user-guide/stereotype-icon/)  and you can register those svg files as customized icons in an arbitrary existing Astah project.

### Basics on constructing a model of C4model

1. Create a class diagram.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_02a.png)
2. Create a class with a stereotype «Software System» on that diagram. One of the possible ways to add a stereotype to a class is first you select a class on a diagram, then you can see a property view for the class and you can choose stereotypes from a pull-down menu in the stereotype tab.  Although, for modeling with the C4 model, several specific stereotypes are used, you can also introduce arbitrary stereotypes.   
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_03a.png)
3. Next, while the created class diagram is displayed, push "Refresh (based on model)" button on C4model Tab in Extension Tab.  Just after the action, the diagram editor must be like the following:
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_06a.png)
   - At this point, fix those texts. Then the status will be changed as follows:
     ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_07a.png)
     As you can see, the name of and the stereotype are placed on the Customized Icon associated with the stereotype «Software System».  Moreover, if the target class does not have an attribute named "description", then the triggered actions by the button include to introduce that attribute and set "(undefined)" as an initial value.  
   - Now, try to move the Customized Icon (the blue rectangle) of the class on the diagram to some extent.
     ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_08a.png)
   - You will see that the positions of the Customized Icon and the Texts in Diagrams on that Customized Icon are not well-alined. Then, push the button "Refresh（based on model）" in the C4model Tab.
      ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_09b.png)
     As you see, the Customized Icon of the target class and the Texts in Diagrams representing the information of the class are independent diagram elements but the plugin holds the the relationship and using the information the plugin also alines their positions appropriately. 
4. The next action is to edit attributes of C4 model elements through diagram elements. Change the Text in Diagram representing the class name through the Diagram editor.  Change from "Class0" to "Class1".
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_10b.png)
   - Take a look at the structure tree.  At this timing, the structure of the model is not changed.  Them push "Reflect c4model texts to the model".
     ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_11a.png)
     After that, you can see that the change has been reflected to the structure of the model.

### Create relations between model elements in C4model
1. Prepare any two C4 model model elements as follows.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_12.png)
2. Next, try to draw dashed arrow between two diagram elements of the C4 model. The dashed arrow means a dependency relation in the UML context .
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_13.png)
3. Here, write the definition of the dependency relation.  A definition of an dependency relation can be inputted through the property view of the relation.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_14.png)
   
4. After determining the definition, push "Reflect c4model texts to the model".
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_15.png)
As you see, the definition you wrote is reflected to the diagram. 

### Use several Customized Icons for one stereotype
For example, you may want to use different Customized Icons for different C4 model elements those have the same ≪Container≫ stereotype.
Astah supports associating two or more Customized Icons for one stereotype.
In the skelton project file you downloaded, several Customized Icons for «Container» and «Software System» are already associated. Let's try it.
1. First, prepare some Container elements.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_16.png)
2. Next, choose one and click with your right mouse button, then you will see a Context menu.  
   From the menu, choose "Set Customized Icon ...",
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_32.png)
   - then you will see the Customized Icon Set Window as follows.
      ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_17.png)
3. Among the registered Customized Icons shown in the window, choose any icon. For example, if you choose the application-look icon, then the appearance of the model element will be changed as follows:  
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_18.png)
4. Changing the Customized Icons for other model elements, for example, containers can be represented with several appearances as follows:
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_19.png)
   
### Changing font size
1. Choose any text on a Customized Icon that you want to change its font size and push the "Set Font" button in the tool buttons.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_20.png)
2. For example, choose font size 16.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_21.png)
3. You can see the font of the text gets larger.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_22.png)
### Create abstraction relation
Next let us see how we can create and represent abstract relations among model elements, which is indispensable in C4 model modeling.  Assume you want to model the situation that some software system is concretized into three Containers,  MyContainer1, MyContainer2, and MyContainer3.
1. First, prepare model elements.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_23.png)
2. Then, associate them with nest relations.   A nest relation can be created, for example, through the button in the tool bar.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_24.png)
   - Here, from the Structure Tree, you can recognize the nest relations you created are reflected to the model structure.
3. After associating model elements with nest relations, push "Reflect c4model texts to the model" button in the C4model Tab.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_25.png)
   You can see that a Rectangle representing the abstraction relation.  More precisely, the rectangle covers model elements those has the common parent model element with respect to the nest relation.
   Such rectangles will be displayed even if a parent model element does not appear in the same diagram.  That is, a set of model elements in  diagram that share the common parent model element in the Structure Tree would be covered by a rectangle.   
4. Let us try with a newly created diagram.
   Create a new class diagram in the same project.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_26.png)
5. Let us deploy diagram elements of the existing model elements.  More precisely, drag the models  MyContainer1，MyContainer2，MyContainer3, and MyClass1 from the Structure Tree and drop them on to the diagram.
   After the drag and drop actions, the diagram must be as follows.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_27.png)
6. Align those diagram element appropriately.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_28.png)
7. At this point, push "Reflect c4model texts to the model" button.
   ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_29.png)
   As you see, the diagram elements MyContainer1，MyContainer2，MyContainer3 that have the common parent model element are covered by a rectangle with the information on the parent model.
### Others
* For Container and Component model elements, an attribute "technology" would be introduced and displayed on the diagram element after the stereotype name, i.e. "Component: (technology)" where "(technology)" is replaced by the value of the "techonology" attribute".
  ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_30.png)
* For relations, there is no special place to store the technology attribute.  To draw technologies for relations, for example, just write information on technology in the definition of the dependency relation as follows.
  ![Sample Image](doc/c4model_31.png)
* Note that the "undo" action for the action triggered by "Reflect c4model texts to the model" requires several actions of holding button down since one action of "Reflect c4model texts to the model" button implies several Astah editing actions.
